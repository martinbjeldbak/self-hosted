This repository contains a backup of my Home Assistant configuration.

Home assistant is installed via [hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B connected to my home network.

## Home Assistant Integrations

I have the following integrations set up via the UI

* AdGuard Home
* Apple TV (from HACS, see below)
* HTTPS Certificate Expiry
* Philips Hue
* Apple iCloud
* Met.no
* Plex
* Spotify
* Transmission

## Home Assistant Custom Components

I am also using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) for improved Apple TV support, TP-Link Tapo integration, among other addons.
